-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

AsterQuant: tool for Quantitative analysis of Multi aster systems using computational geometric methods to measure packing statistics and spatial analysis

Developed for Multi - aster project and has been extended to multiple systems in experiments

Primarily Developed by Neha Khetan, <khetanneha@gmail.com>, <neha.khetan@students.iiserpune.ac.in> for the work published as 
_Khetan N, Pruliere G, Hebras C, Chenevert J and Athale CA. (2021) Self-organized optimal packing of kinesin- 5-driven microtubule asters scales with cell size. J Cell Sci. 134(10):jcs257543_

Further improvements, additional methods, measures and analysis added for the developement of the tool.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The work pursued 2017- 2021 shared in 3 branches 

1. Branch (master) :post-jcs-2021. Updates on the many different measures for analysis and from different systems,  post JCS paper in 2021.

2. Branch: v3_jcs. Parts of the work published in Khetan N, Pruliere G, Hebras C, Chenevert J and Athale CA. (2021) Self-organized optimal packing of kinesin- 5-driven microtubule asters scales with cell size. J Cell Sci. 134(10):jcs257543

3. Branch: AsterQuant. Development until 2021, JCS
